# adafruit-tft-lcd-image-cycling-example

This is a super simple example Arduino sketch for cycling through different images on the [Adafruit 1.44"" Color TFT LCD Display with MicroSD Card breakout (ST7735R).](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2088)

To run this, all you need to do is place bitmap images on the root directory of the MicroSD card. From there, you can simply flash this sketch on your Arduino and let it rip.
